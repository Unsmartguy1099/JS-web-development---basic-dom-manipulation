Tools used:
1. HTML - as the frame
2. CSS - for styling the frame
3. Vanila Javascript - for manupulating the dom

The whole HTML section can be manipulated by Javascript. As HTML determines what will be shown in the webpage, we can create interactive web page by using Javascript and HTML in tandem.
